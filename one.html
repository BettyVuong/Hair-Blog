            When learning about hairstyling, people don't expect there to be more than the application of techniques.
            But being a hairstylist means being well-versed in hair theory. Understanding the anatomy, structure, and
            properties of hair is very important. Understanding the anatomy of the skull is important for understanding
            application areas, technique markers, and more. When looking into hair colouring, it is also an art
            meaning that colour theory is vital to the craft. The amount of theory in hair and hairstyling took me by
            surprise, and I'm assuming it did for you as well. I'll be summarizing some key ideas and making concise
            notes
            in this article but I encourage you to learn more on your own using the <i>Milady Standard Cosmetology by
                Catherine M Frangie</i> textbook.

            <p>This was the textbook I used when I was learning about hair theory, but feel free to use any edition of
                the textbook
                for the fundamentals, not much has changed in terms of the foundations. I would warn readers to be
                careful of reading
                any esthetics related topic in the book since a lot of scientific discovery has been found and
                contradicts what scientist
                intially found. To my knowledge, this is the standard textbook used in cosmetology school.

        <div class="p-left">
            <p>A strand of hair has three layers, the <i><b>cuticle</b></i>, <i><b>cortex</b></i>, and the
                <i><b>medulla</b></i>.
                The <i><b>cuticle</b></i> is the outermost layer of the hair, it has a fish scale like layer that
                overlaps hair cells. The
                cuticle protects the inner layers of the hair. The cuticle is tight and close to the cortex to maintain
                the
                integrity
                of the hair. The <i><b>cortex</b></i> is the next layer. It is composed of this fibre-rich protein that
                has
                cells containing melanin.
                <i><b> Melanin</b></i> is a pigment that provides hair its colour. There are two types of melanin,
                <i><b>eumelanin</b></i> and
                <i><b>pheomelanin</b></i>. The difference is that eumelanin has brown and black pigment while
                pheomelanin
                has red, orange and
                yellow pigment. Keep this in mind for the discussion on hair levels. The cortex is also responsible for
                the
                elasticity of
                your hair, which is vital since our hair would snap off easily otherwise. Lastly, the
                <i><b>medulla</b></i>
                is the innermost layer of the hair.
                The medulla is typically only present in darker, coarser, or thicker hair and is not relevant in hair
                theory.

    <article class="about">
        <div class="p-left">
            <p>Hair is really rich in protein, its chemical composition can be denoted as <b>COHNS</b>, which is
                carbon, oxygen, hydrogen, nitrogen, and sulfur. <i><b>Proteins</b></i> are chains of amino acids which
                are bonded
                by peptide bonds. This is called a polypeptide chain. The cortex is composed of a lot of polypeptide
                chains
                there are three types of bonds that hold the chains together to form the cortex. They are called
                <b><i>side bonds</i></b> and are responsible for the health, elasticity, and strength of the hair.
            </p>
            <p><i><b>Hydrogen Bonds</b> </i> are the weakest bonds and are broken every time they encounter water or heat.
                The bonds are reformed when the hair is cooled and dry. Typically, these bonds are broken when you style
                your hair.
            </p>
            <p><i><b>Salt bonds</b></i> are weak and are dependent on pH, thus they are broken by alkaline and acidic
                solutions, which is important for hair colouring products.
            </p>
            <p><i><b>Disulfide bonds</b></i> are strong and are very difficult to break.</p>

    <article class="about">
        <div class="p-left">
            <p>In the hair industry, hair colour is classified by a <b>level</b> system. This maintains a standard 
                that can easily be communicated and identified by hairstylists and hair product companies. 
                The levels determine how light the hair colour is, the darkest colour is level 1, and the lightest 
                colour is level 10. Although there is a debate within the industry if a level 10 is valid!
            </p>
            <p>
                Remember the talk about the two types of melanin? Since hair pigment is composed of melanin, the 
                contributing pigment is the warmth in the hair that composes the colours that we see. For example, 
                level one hair contains both pheomelanin and eumelanin which is why its contributing pigments look 
                red-brown. While level 9 hair only contains pheomelanin which is why the contributing pigments are yellow.
            </p>
            <p>
                When we "bleach" or lighten hair using chemicals, what we are doing is removing the melanin from the hair. 
                The measure of how much melanin is removed from the hair and the levels the hair increases by is called 
                <i><b>lift</b></i>.
                 Certain lighteners that are colour (such as hi-lift or permanent) have a pH level that can lift the cuticle to remove the melanin pigments. 
                 Bleach has a lower pH, penetrating the cortex even further by swelling up the cuticle cells. This allows for 
                 the bleach to remove more pigment and sometimes destroy the protein composition which is why we see hair melt 
                 off if not under expert supervision. Thus, it makes sense that when darker hair gets lightened, it tends to 
                 be very warm, think about how much pigment has to be removed to get it to a higher level!

            That pretty much covers some basic theory for hair. I know it's a lot to read all at once but I promise this was much shorter 
            than the reading I had to do to be sure that I'm providing you with the right information! I condensed a lot of the theory up 
            since it's a good refresher to read or, provides a starting point on key ideas you should focus on if you are 
            overwhelmed by all the information scattered across the internet and textbooks. I would love to elaborate and touch on some 
            more complex topics such as different hair colouring chemicals, colour theory in hair colouring, and hair analysis for 
            client consultations! I'll cover these topics after I write some stuff that's less theory-intensive to give you all some 
            time to absorb and learn the theory I've covered.<br><br>Until next time,<br><br>Betty
