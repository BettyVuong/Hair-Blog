            <p>
                Have any questions about hair related things? This blog will cover almost anything you can think of.
                Ranging from the basics of hair theory, to daily tools I've used and recommend. My blog is a safe space to
                 learn things that aren't typically free education. 
            </p>
            <p>
                 Here's why: As a mostly self taught hairstylist, I found myself frustrated at how hard it was to learn 
                 the proper things, where to get started, or what I need to know. Throughout learning hair more seriously 
                 starting in 2020, I've been able to gather some knowledge and experience to share to you. I want to be able
                  to help and make an impact on someone who was at the same spot as I was when I started to dabble into the 
                hair industry.

            <p>I'm currently studying Computer Science at the University of Guelph. But I have always had a passion for 
                anything beauty related. Since I was 4, I've been braiding hair and started taking hairstyling more seriously 
                when the global pandemic hit. With a lot of spare time, I went into a deep dive about hair theory and techniques. 
                I specialize in hairstyling and hair colouring, specifically mastering the balayage technique. I've also taken 
                cosmetology courses to ensure that I adhere to safe practices and built a strong foundation in hair theory. 
                I take clients a few times within the year typically doing balayages, or hairstyles if it's a special occasion. 
                During my spare time, I enjoy reading, pilates, shopping, and of course coding!
            </p>
            <p>I'm currently mastering colour formulations since there's a complexity to the colour theory, chemistry, colour lines, 
                and reliability. I typically do blondes, brunettes, brondes, and auburns, so fashion colours and reds are an unfamiliar 
                territory for me. Colour formulations also come with years of experience, with only 5 years of colouring experience and 
                mainly as a hobby, I don't gain as much experimental practice. If there are readers with some advice or input, please 
                reach out and let me know! In the future, I want to pick up barbering, women's cuts, and extension installation.
