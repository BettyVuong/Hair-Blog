    <h1><mark>Introduction </mark></h1>
    <p>Let's discuss some hairstylists must haves and classics. There's a reason certain products are used by
        hairstylists universally. I'm going to talk about some hot tools, brushes, and accessories that are a
        holy grail by the industry. Typically you can find these products on Amazon, Sephora, Chatters, Walmart,
        Shoppers Drug Mart, May&Max, your local beauty supply store, and more! Since I have a license, I could purchase
        some licensed exclusives at CosmoProf but I'd encourage you to talk to your hairstylist, they'll likely
        be selling the thing you're looking for or something similar.

    <h1><mark><b>Curling Iron</b> - Hot Tools </mark></h1>
</article>
<article class="about">
    <div clas="p-right">
        <p>
            Hot Tools is a popular brand for hairstylists and their preferance for curling irons. The 
            <i>Signature Gold</i> series is not too expensive, durable, and high quality. The curling irons 
            doesn't snag your hair, heats up fast, and the spring it smooth. I'd recommend the 1-1/4" barrel since 
            it's a versatile curl.

            BabylissPRO is another brand that's popular to hairstylists for curling irons. The performance is 
            similar to Hot Tools. The difference here is that the clamp is removable which is great for those 
            who prefer to wrap their hair around the wand instead of using the clamp and twisting the barrel.

    <h1><mark><b>Hair Brush</b> - The Wet Brush </mark></h1>
</article>
<article class="about">
    <div clas="p-right">
        <p>
            What is so different about this hairbrush? Let me tell you, everyone I've given a Wet Brush to has 
            joined some secret fan club for this product. A fellow hairstylist tried and can confirm it's the best on 
            the market. The bristles are a patented design that's soft and 
            flexible, which does not as much as a normal brush does. This brush lets you safely brush your wet hair 
            without worrying about hair breakage. No more ripping out your hair or having a mental fight with your 
            hair brush!
